		//NOTES:

		// (need to figure out how binarization is achieved -- see .isolevel and interpolatorClass)
		//
		//That seems to be an implementation of http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/
		//(which is likely a defacto standard approach, 1st hit on Google at least)
		//
		//once image is meshified, go through all facets of the mesh and stretch vertices
		//according to the current resolution, call mesh.getSurfaceArea() afterwards
		//
		//(alternatively, make a copy of the MC class, and change it by
		// incorporating the resolution directly, see L178-L186)
		//
		//some MC is in 3D_Viewer by Ulrik, some MC is done Kyle...
